    Creates a 1D or 2D wavelet filterbank along with each wavelet's corresponding frequency axis frequency, time axis
    frequency, and orientation (if 1D for the time axis and if 2D for the frequency axis).

    For easier to read notation and consistency with scalograms and convolution outputs, we always define the last
    dimension (dim=-1) as the time dimension "t" and the second last dimension (dim=-2) as the frequency dimension "f".

    We consider 1D wavelet filterbanks as operating on the time axis and 2D wavelet filterbanks as operating on both.
